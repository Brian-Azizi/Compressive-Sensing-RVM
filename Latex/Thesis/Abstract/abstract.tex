This thesis details the development of a complete Compressive Sensing system that allows for near-perfect reconstruction of video signals from measurement sets as small as 30\% the size of the original signal.

This is achieved by exploiting the signal's inherent compressibility.
In the Compressive Sensing framework, reconstruction is done by searching for the sparsest signal in a transformed domain that is consistent with the measurements set.

In the thesis, the Compressive Sensing problem is approached from a Bayesian perspective and reformulated as a regression problem.
The Relevance Vector Machine was implemented and used to find very sparse solution in the wavelet or the discrete cosine transform domain.
