\begin{enumerate}
\item Main Draw back: slow decoder -> parallel
\end{enumerate}

This chapter gives a brief description of the current state of our implementation of the 3D signal reconstructer.

Comparing notation to the previous chapter, what we refer to as $W$ here is the transpose of what was previously denoted as $\Psi$.
And since $\bs v = W^T \hat{\bs v}$, we see that $\bs v$ corresponds to what was previously called $\bs x$.
