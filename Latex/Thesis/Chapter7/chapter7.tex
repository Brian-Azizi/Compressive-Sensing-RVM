\section{Performance Metrics}
In this section, we will introduce three performance metrics that are often used to measure the quality of reconstructed images and videos.

Let $\bm \hat{v} \in\mathbb{R}^M$ be a reconstructed signal (in vectorized form) and let $\bm v$ be the corresponding orginal signal.
The \emph{mean square error} (MSE) of the reconstruction is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  \mse(\bm{\hat v}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^M (\hat v_i - v_i)^2}{M}
\end{equation*}
The MSE is zero if and only if we $\bm{\hat v}$ is an exact reconstruction of $\bm v$.

Using the MSE, we can compute the \emph{Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio} (PSNR) of the reconstruction:
\begin{equation*}
  \psnr(\bm{\hat v}) = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left(\frac{R^2}{\mse(\bm{\hat v})}\right)
\end{equation*}
where $R$ is the maximum fluctuation in the input signal data type. 
For grayscale images or videos in which the pixel values are stored as 8-bit unsigned integers, we have that $R = 256$.

The PSNR is usually expressed in term of decibel (dB). 
Higher values of the PSNR correspond to more accurate reconstructions.
The PSNR is widely used in the image and video compression literature to measure the quality of a compressed signal.
Generally, when comparing the reconstruction quality, the PSNR should only be used if it was measured on the same signal.

The final performance metric that we compute is the \emph{relative reconstruction error}.
It is given by
\begin{equation*}
  \rre(\bm{\hat v}) = \frac{||\bm{\hat v} - \bm v||_2}{||\bm v||_2}
\end{equation*}
This is the metric that was used in \cite{ji2008} and \cite{pilikos2014}.
