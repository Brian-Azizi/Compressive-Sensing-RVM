\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Metrics: PSNR, (Relative Error), (FSIM)
\item DCT for BCS of images and videos (put in Results)?
\item Full Res vs Pre-compressed: With full res, I need a lot of samples to get perfect reconstruction. With pre-comp, I'm not sure.
\item Curve: Performance vs Compression
\item Masks vs Gaussian vs Rademacher
\item Full Scale Haar vs DCT
\item What't the best performance I can achieve? How does it compare to the lit?
\item Example Results
\item MSCE was done to solve the signal interpolation. In particular, to fix the problem with small support of wavelets while still using their power.
\item Problem: Slow. Solution: Parallelization.
\item Problem: Limited to signal interpolation. Solution: Use CS sensing matrices (but Cascade don't work yet).
\item Do we even need the cascade? What if we jump straight to the third scale.
\item Can we improve the performance of the interpolator? 
\item Small blocks reduce performance due to less data for RVM
\item When is MPI useful
\item What should $\sigma^2$ be.
\item Modified Error Bars
\end{enumerate}

\section{Video Reconstruction for General Sensing Matrices}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For certain basis functions, the matrix $\bm\Psi$ will be very sparse. It is possible to exploit this sparsity to significantly reduce the memory requirements. 
\item General sensing Matrix for BCS of videos?
\end{enumerate}
