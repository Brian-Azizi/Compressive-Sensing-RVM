\chapter{Still To Do}

\section{Dissertation}
\subsubsection{Extensive Literature Review}
A significant part of the project will be an extensive review on the current literature in the field of video reconstruction and video encoding.
A more extensive review of the Compressive Sensing framework may also be included here as well as, potentially, the theory of wavelets. 


\subsubsection{Performance Analysis}
There are two parts to this. First, how is the performance affected by different settings of the parameters of the algorithm.
Secondly, how does our method compare to other existing signal reconstruction methods? Under what circumstances we get superior performance? How could we improve the method?
