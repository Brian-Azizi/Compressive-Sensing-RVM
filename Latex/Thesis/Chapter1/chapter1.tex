\chapter{Introduction}

There are three parts: A signal processing framework called \emph{Compressive Sensing (CS)}, a pre-processing step in form of a basis transformation based on discrete wavelet transforms and a Machine Learning algorithm called \emph{Sparse Bayesian Learning}.

The key notion that ties in these three areas is the notion of \emph{sparsity}.
